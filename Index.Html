      <h3>
        Certainly! Here are 20 practical questions related to working with
        arrays in JavaScript:
      </h3>
      1. **Sum of Array Elements:** Write a function that calculates the sum of
      all the elements in an array of numbers.<br />
      2. **Find Maximum Value:** Create a function that finds the maximum value
      in an array of numbers.<br />
      3. **Filter Even Numbers:** Write a function that takes an array of
      numbers and returns a new array with only the even numbers.<br />
      4. **Reverse an Array:** Create a function that reverses the order of
      elements in an array without modifying the original array.<br />
      5. **Remove Duplicates:** Write a function that removes duplicate elements
      from an array while preserving the original order.<br />
      6. **Concatenate Arrays:** How do you concatenate two arrays in
      JavaScript?<br />
      7. **Slice and Splice:** Explain the difference between `slice` and
      `splice` methods when working with arrays.<br />
      8. **Sort an Array:** How can you sort an array of strings in alphabetical
      order?<br />
      9. **Search for an Element:** Write a function that searches for a
      specific element in an array and returns its index, or -1 if it's not
      found.<br />
      10. **Array Manipulation:** Given an array of numbers, write a function
      that multiplies each element by a specified factor and returns the
      modified array. <br />
      11. **Find the Average:** Write a function that calculates the average
      (mean) of all the elements in an array of numbers.
      <br />
      12. **Remove All Occurrences:** Create a function that removes all
      occurrences of a specific value from an array and returns a new array
      without those values.
      <br />
      13. **Flatten Nested Arrays:** Write a function that flattens a nested
      array (an array of arrays) into a single flat array.
      <br />
      14. **Count Occurrences:** Create a function that counts how many times a
      specific value appears in an array.
      <br />
      15. **Unique Values:** Write a function that returns an array containing
      only the unique values from the original array (removing duplicates).
      <br />
      16. **Chunk into Groups:** Create a function that chunks an array into
      smaller arrays of a specified size. For example, chunk `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
      into groups of size 2: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`.
      <br />
      17. **Rotate Array:** Write a function that rotates the elements of an
      array to the right by a given number of positions. For example, rotating
      `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` by 2 positions would result in `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.
      <br />
      18. **Merging Arrays:** Combine two arrays into a single array without any
      duplicate values.
      <br />
      19. **Sum of Two Arrays:** Create a function that takes two arrays of
      numbers and returns a new array containing the element-wise sum of the two
      arrays.
      <br />
      20. **Shuffle an Array:** Write a function that shuffles the elements of
      an array randomly so that the order is different each time you call the
      function.
      <br />
      These additional questions should provide you with more opportunities to
      practice and expand your skills in working with arrays in JavaScript.

      <h3>
        Certainly! Here are 10 slightly more challenging, yet still
        beginner-friendly questions related to arrays in JavaScript:
      </h3>
      <br />
      21. **Palindrome Check:** Create a function that checks if a given array
      is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g.,
      `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`).
      <br />
      22. **Find Missing Number:** Write a function that finds the missing
      number in an array of consecutive numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 4, 5]` is missing
      `3`).
      <br />
      23. **Largest Sum Subarray:** Find the subarray within an array that has
      the largest sum of elements and return that sum.
      <br />
      24. **Remove Negatives:** Create a function that removes all negative
      numbers from an array and returns a new array with only the positive
      numbers.
      <br />
      25. **Intersection of Arrays:** Write a function that finds the common
      elements between two arrays and returns them as a new array.
      <br />
      26. **Array Rotation:** Implement a function that rotates an array to the
      left by a given number of positions. For example, rotating `[1, 2, 3, 4,
      5]` by 2 positions would result in `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.
      <br />
      27. **Second Largest Number:** Find the second largest number in an array
      without sorting it.
      <br />
      28. **Count Words:** Create a function that counts the occurrences of each
      word in an array of words.
      <br />
      29. **Array Partition:** Divide an array into two subarrays, one with
      even-indexed elements and the other with odd-indexed elements, and return
      them as two separate arrays.
      <br />
      30. **Max Consecutive Sum:** Find the maximum sum of consecutive elements
      in an array (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, -2, 5]` has a maximum consecutive sum of
      `9`).
      <br />
      These questions provide opportunities for deeper exploration of array
      manipulation and problem-solving in JavaScript. They are a bit more
      challenging but still well-suited for beginners looking to improve their
      skills with arrays.
